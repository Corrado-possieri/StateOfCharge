# StateOfCharge
Estimate the state of charge of a battery

The code samplerMatalbSin has to be loaded on an Arduino Uno (note that such a code does 
not compile for other version of Arduino since it uses registers that are available
just for such a version of Arduino).

The code realTimeObs.m has to be executed in Matlab to run a real time observer for the 
state of charge of a battery.
